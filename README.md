The Workout app is developed in Swift, accompanied by an SQL database and a PHP API.

I developed the app because it is difficult to track workout progression. Using the app, I can conveniently track any aspect of my workouts.
I can create a workout (eg Push day) and allocate exercises (eg Bench press, Shoulder press) and log my results by weight and number of reps.
Workouts, exercises and results each have a class in the app and a table in the database.
Workouts, exercises and results can be created using the app, which will instantly post results to the database. Any records may also be dropped from the database.
